# Pi-Pico-Weather-Station-for-Education
Weather Station based of the Raspberry Pi Pico, tailored for use in education.

The goal of this project is to develop a modular, easy to build weather station using Piicodev components and the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Current Goals for the project are:
- Compile a Bill of Materials (BOM) containing the bare necessities, with a list of option add-ons, including costs to assist in conforming to individual budgets.
- Develop a single script with easy to configure options to select what sensors are being used and also how the information from these sensors is displayed/recorded.
- Design 3D printed replacements for items for those that have access to a 3D printer to minimise costs.
- Write a detailed guide from start to finish for the project, including images. (the project is aimed at primary and secondary school children)
